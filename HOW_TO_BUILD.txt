                        SEAM CARVING TOOL - HOW TO BUILD
================================================================================

This repository is set up with a Portable Python environment. 
You do NOT need to install Python or libraries globally on your machine.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

1. Ensure the "python_portable" folder exists in the root directory.
   (This contains the isolated Python environment required for the build).

2. Double-click "ALL_SETUP.bat".

   - This script will:
     1. Clean up old build artifacts.
     2. Install necessary libraries (numpy, opencv, scipy, pyinstaller) 
        into the portable environment.
     3. Compile all Python scripts into standalone .exe files.
     4. Move the executables into the "SeamCarvingApp" folder.

3. Check "build_log.txt" if any errors occur.

4. Once complete, navigate to the "SeamCarvingApp" folder and run
   "SeamCarvingApp.exe" to test your build.
