# Seam Carving Implementation

This project implements content-aware image resizing using seam carving algorithms, including both dynamic programming and greedy approaches.

## Overview

Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing that removes low-energy seams (paths of pixels) from an image to reduce its size while preserving important content. This implementation provides two algorithms:

- **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**: Optimal seam removal using dynamic programming
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Faster approximation using greedy selection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager
