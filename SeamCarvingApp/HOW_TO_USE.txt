                        SEAM CARVING TOOL - HOW TO USE
================================================================================

This folder contains the pre-built application.
No installation needed.

HOW TO USE
----------

1. Put your images in the "images" folder.
   (Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png)

2. Double-click "SeamCarvingApp.exe".
   (Do not run the .bat file, use the Application .exe).

3. Choose an option from the menu:

   OPTIONS 1-3 (Standard Algorithms):
   ----------------------------------
   1. Dynamic Programming (Optimal)
   2. Greedy Algorithm (Fast)
   3. Graph-Cut (Shortest Path Algorithm)

     - You will be asked for:
       - Input image name (e.g., input.jpg)
       - Output image name (e.g., result)
       - Number of seams to remove (e.g., 50)
       - Direction: "vertical" (width) or "horizontal" (height)
     
     - Visualization:
       - Answer 'y' to see the red seam being removed step-by-step.
       - Note: This significantly slows down the process.

   OPTION 4 (Interactive Tool):
   ----------------------------
     - You will be asked for the input image name.
     - The tool will take a moment to "Pre-compute" the cache. 
       Please wait for the loading percentage to finish.
     
     - Once the window opens:
       - Drag the "Width" slider for instant resizing.
       - Drag the "Height" slider (updates when you release the mouse).
       - Press 's' to save the result to "images/interactive_result.jpg".
       - Press 'q' or ESC to close the tool.

4. Check your results in the "images" folder.
   - For standard algorithms, a "comparison.jpg" is also generated.
